Crop Recommendation and Prediction App
Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets for building a Crop Recommendation and Prediction App using R. The app leverages various features like temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and location to recommend the best crops for specific conditions and predict crop suitability based on environmental factors.

Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests suitable crops based on input conditions.
Crop Prediction: Predicts crop types based on historical and environmental data.
Data Analysis: Utilizes data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis techniques.
Machine Learning Models: Implements models to predict and recommend crops with high accuracy.
Interactive UI: Provides an interactive interface for users to input data and view results.
Dataset
The dataset (Updated_Crop_recom_with_location.csv) includes the following columns:

N: Nitrogen content in the soil
P: Phosphorous content in the soil
K: Potassium content in the soil
Temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius
Humidity: Percentage of humidity
pH: pH level of the soil
Rainfall: Rainfall in millimeters
Label: Crop type
Location: Geographic location of the soil sample
Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: R
Libraries:
tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization
caret: For machine learning model building
shiny: For creating the interactive app
ggplot2: For visualization
Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-recommendation-app.git
Open the project in RStudio.
Install required libraries:
R
Copy code
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "shiny", "ggplot2"))

Usage
Run the analysis script for exploratory data analysis and model training:
R
Copy code
source("analysis.R")
Launch the Shiny app:
R
Copy code
shiny::runApp("app")
Input environmental parameters and get crop recommendations and predictions.
